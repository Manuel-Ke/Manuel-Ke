Nice to meet you! My name is Enqi Ke or you can call me Manuel. 

Now I am an undergraduate in University of Science and Technology of China (i.e. USTC), majoring in optics, a branch of physics. 

Optics is a subject studying the property and applications of light. Interestingly, I am also a follower of the True Light, that is, Jesus Christ according to John 1:9. If you are interested in both optics and Christianity, feel free to contact me! 

My email is: keq0922@gmail.com. 

Thank you for visiting my homepage! Looking forward to seeing you again!
